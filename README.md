Photo Word Finder App

## Description

The Photo Word Finder app is a tool to assist you by extracting words from your photos and searching for them.
The app recognizes text in the photo regardless of the alignment or orientation of the image.

This app is written in Flutter using these technologies:
Markup : 1. The Flutter UI Toolkit for crafting the user interface.
    2. The Google Machine Learning Vision kit using Text Recognition (Optical Character Recognition). This is provided for Flutter in the package firebase_ml_vision.
    3. The image_picker package to access your device's photo gallery.
    4. The url_launcher package to enable web searching from the app.
    5. The flutter_tags package by Antonio Di Natale to allow editing of the words found in your photos prior to searching for them.
